    <h1>Write a Game</h1>
    <p>
      I have wanted to write a game for a long time, perhaps since I was six.
      The oldest game I remember is Galaga!
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the time since then I have started many games, but finished none.
      With the benefit of hindsight I can say that two factors contributed to
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scope of all of my games has exceeded my ability. I am an experienced
      programmer, I do not think that this exercise is beyond me. However my
      knowledge and intuition does not apply directly to games. I need to take
      some time to develop my game skills (whatever those are) from the very
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not have a lot of time to commit to any project. To stay motivated I
      need to make tangible progress with small increments. Starting a project
      with a big plan makes it challenging to appreciate what you have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      With both of these in mind I decided to make my biggest constraint and weakness
      the center of a new project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can put in an hour of work at a time.
      So I will focus on doing as much as possible with that hour, focusing on
      what can be done, instead of what remains to be done. My hope is for this
      game to be a journey of learning, with no pre-ordained goal.
    </p>
    <h2>Hour 1 <a href="hour-1/hour-1.html">&#10144;</a></h2>
    <p>
      To write a playable game in one hour. It is necessary to limit the game as much
      as possible. For this hour I am going to constrain player input to clicks.
      With no other options the click can only modify a single variable. In the
      grand tradition of iphone games this can change a player's y velocity
      while x velocity is fixed within a game world.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, flappy bird.
    </p>
    <h2>Interlude</h2>
    <p>
      Ive spent much more time than I wanted (probably a couple of hours now)
      getting the game hosted on Heroku. They now support auto deploy from Github,
      so I had to try that out. At the same time I also wanted to see events in Slack.
      Travis is sitting in there running the build for the game and all of its tests.
      Heroku waits for Travis to give it the green light, and Travis posts a notification
      to a Slack channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have implemented this page and hosting for the game as Github Pages.
      But I'm guessing it wont be too long before I want to put in some server side
      functionality. This also gives me a chance to try out the Github Flow process
      and continuous integration/deployment.
    </p>
    <h2>Hour 2 <a href="hour-2/hour-2.html">&#10144;</a></h2>
    <p>
      Clony Balony isnt much of a game! But there is a playfield and a player moves within it.
      This hour I'll add a score, and maybe even a way to get some points.
